/**
 * A React hook that allows you to queue up functions to be executed in order.
 * This is useful when you need to ensure long running networks requests are processed sequentially.
 * Builds up a "queue" of functions to be executed in order, only ever processing the last function in the queue.
 * This ensures that a long queue of tasks doesn't cause a backlog of tasks to be processed.
 * E.g. if you queue a task and it begins running, then you queue 9 more tasks:
 *   1. The currently task will finish
 *   2. The next task in the queue will run
 *   3. All remaining tasks will be discarded
 * @returns {queueTask} A function used to queue a function.
 * @example
 * const { queueTask } = useQueues()
 * queueTask(async () => {
 *   await fetch('https://api.example.com')
 * })
