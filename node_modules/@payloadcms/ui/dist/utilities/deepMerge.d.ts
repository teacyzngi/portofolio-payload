/**
 * Very simple, but fast deepMerge implementation. Only deepMerges objects, not arrays and clones everything.
 * Do not use this if your object contains any complex objects like React Components, or if you would like to combine Arrays.
 * If you only have simple objects and need a fast deepMerge, this is the function for you.
 *
 * obj2 takes precedence over obj1 - thus if obj2 has a key that obj1 also has, obj2's value will be used.
 *
 * @param obj1 base object
 * @param obj2 object to merge "into" obj1
